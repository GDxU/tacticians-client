      <h3>Currently running: Latest Dev. Build</h3>
      <p>This website lets you play the game even during its development phase. As a result, there is a lot missing.</p>
      <p>
         Having accounts at that stage would needlessly slow us down, so access to
         <a href="/battlemap/">the game's battle system</a> is done without login in.
      </p>
